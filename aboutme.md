![Photo of me climbing Roy's Peak in Wanaka, NZ](/images/about/portrait.jpg)

When I'm not hunched over a laptop, I like hiking. Sometimes I play Dungeons & Dragons!

Right now I'm studying design in Wellington, New Zealand facing new challenges and building up some good habits, like going to the library.
