## Problem
Nestl&#233; New Zealand has been losing market share to Cadbury's Moro Bar. Naomi and I were tasked to research and position a new novelty chocolate bar brand as a compelling alternative to Moro to obtain Nestl&#233; market leadership.  

## Brand History

## Emerging Macrotrends
### Conscious Consumerism
- More New Zealanders are likely to pay more for products that are socially and environmentally responsible
- Consumers seek organic, sustainable, locally sourced products
- *Provenance*, where ingredients come from, is important

### Digitally Connected Culture

- Current generation so familiar with technology they are considered digital natives
- Mobile phones prevalent throughout daily life

## Concept
### People are concerned about shopping consciously and Nestl&#233;'s unethical history, so Nestl&#233; should introduce a novelty chocolate bar that is a *more* ethical choice.

To respond to Nestl&#233;’s unethical perception, we want to increase awareness of the Cocoa Plan, Nestl&#233;’s recent initiative towards sustainable ingredient sourcing.

We aim to create a more ethical novelty chocolate bar that features *ingredient provenance* and uses *augmented reality* as an informational tool in its packaging.

## Target Audience

## Brand identity
Cocoa pods only grow within 20° of the equator. We chose the name Twenty Degrees as a nod to *provenance*—knowing where ingredients come from-to position our sub-brand as more ethical.

With our packaging and point of sale, we wanted to educate consumers about Nestl&#233;’s efforts towards ethical production with the Cocoa Plan.

To increase the amount of information about Nestl&#233;’s supply chain that a novelty sized chocolate bar could hold, we decided to incorporate an augmented reality experience.

By scanning a Snapcode with the Snapchat app on a mobile phone, consumers are taken on a journey to learn about where their chocolate came from, how it was made, and who was involved in making it.

## Final Design Solution
Twenty Degrees is a novelty chocolate bar that offers transparency of Nestl&#233;’s newer sustainable sourcing efforts through the use of technology while remaining an indulgent treat.
