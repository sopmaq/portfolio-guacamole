## How can we create an haptic interface that facilitates learning?
Keriana and I designed and built a prototype for Spelling Aid, an interactive spelling game aimed at children learning the alphabet.

## Audience
We focused on children learning to spell, specifically children ages 3 - 5. Our interface focuses on helping young children understand the connection between sounds and letters.

## Research
We looked at existing resources such as cards and games to, and we found that spelling 3 letter words was appropriate for children at this age level. The tasks in these games helped us refine the concept for our interface, Spelling Aid.

## Spelling Aid
A child interacts with Spelling Aid by inserting a letter cartridge. If they correctly spell a 3 letter word, the LCD screen will show an image of that word while sounding it out.

## Making the Prototype
We created a basic prototype of our concept using an an Arduino Uno with an LCD screen. We used copper foil to make cartridges that would connect to the Arduino upon contact with foil inside of the cartridge slots.
