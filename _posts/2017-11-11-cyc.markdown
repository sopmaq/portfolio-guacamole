## Background
Consult Your Community (CYC) is a student organization that provides pro-bono consulting services for local businesses. The CYC Chapter at UC Davis (CYC Davis) asked me to help them stand out among other business organizations during busy Fall Recruitment.

## Project Goals

#### 1. Brand Presence
Showcase CYC Davis' unique qualities to help them stand out among the noise of other business clubs recruiting during Fall Quarter.

#### 2. Fall Recruitment
Encourage students to apply to Consult Your Community during Fall Quarter by communicating this brand presence with **flyers** and redesigning CYC Davis' **website**.

## Constraints
I needed to uphold the CYC National branding guidelines. These guidelines are loosely defined, so I referred to past materials such as the organization's logo and wordmark, presentation templates, and marketing collateral passed from the CYC National group to the CYC Davis chapter.

## Developing Brand
During my initial meeting with CYC Davis, I learned that the students who had the best experience in the organization were those with a service interest. CYC Davis suggested "Finding joy in helping others" as a tagline, which I used as a starting point to define the rest of the CYC Davis materials with the intended reach of students with an interest in community service.

After this meeting, I noted that CYC Davis stands out from other organizations because of their real impact in the local community and effort to help others. I aimed to communicate the CYC Davis brand as uplifting and genuine while remaining professional. This lead me to develop a softer, warmer color palette that extends the original CYC navy, and hand-drawn, imperfect imagery.

I also needed to balance out these unique CYC Davis qualities with the CYC National brand. I retained strong use of the deep navy color of the CYC National brand materials, and I chose a serif typeface with qualities similar to the CYC wordmark.

## Flyers
Starting with the "Finding joy in helping others" concept, I designed the following flyer to be passed out at Fall Recruitment events with attention to the CYC Davis brand qualities.

## Web Design Process
The CYC Davis website needs to cater to two audiences: prospective students, who want to join the CYC Davis team as consultants, and local Davis and Sacramento businesses, who are interested in CYC Davis' free consulting services.

The CYC Davis team gave me a document with all of the information they wanted to retain from their old website. I started thinking of ways to organize this information by sketching organization systems visually.

An issue I found with their previous website was that each piece of content had its own page, making an overwhelming number of pages to read. I aimed to make navigation easier for prospective students and clients by condensing information into fewer pages, and incorporating a secondary navigation system helping users navigate through the information on each page (see desktop screenshots).

After developing a method of organizing the information on the website, I created mockups in responsive views for each page to present to the CYC Davis team for feedback.

After a round of feedback, I developed the site using HTML/CSS and the Bootstrap framework. Visit the live website at [cycdavis.com](http://www.cycdavis.com/)!
